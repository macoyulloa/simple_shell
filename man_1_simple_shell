.SH COMMANDS
.PP
The shell interprets the words it reads according to a language.
.PP
he following commands could be managed in these program when it is running, as well as, Plankton could execute the commmands in a interactive and a non interactive (we do not need to call the search Path function, already got it) way:
.PP
```
.PP
echo[arg...]	Each arg is printed to standard output; afterwards, a newline is printed.
.PP
pwd		Prints the name of the current directory.
.PP
touch		[Filename] creates a new file.
.PP
mkdir		[Directory_name] Creates a new directory.
.PP
rm		[Filename] or [Directoryname] Deletes the directory or a file.
.PP
mv		[Filename] [Directory] Changes a file for one directory to another directory.
.PP
```
.PP
.SH BUILT -INS COMMANDS
.PP
```
.PP
exit            Causes the shell to exit with the exit.
.PP
env             Prints the enviroment.
.PP
cd[arg]         Change the current directory to arg. The shell parameter $HOME is the default arg. If no directory arg is found and the $CDPATH parameter contains a list of directories separated by colons, each of these directories is used as a prefix to arg in the given order, and the current directory is set to the first one that is found.
.PP
```
.PP
.BR
.SH SEARCH & EXECUTION
.PP
There are three types of commands: shell functions, built-in commands, and normal programs. The command is searched for (by name) in that order. The three types of commands are all executed in a different way.
.PP
.SH PATH SEARCH
.PP
When locating a command, the shell first looks to see if it has a shell function by that name. Then it looks for a built-in command by that name.  If a built-in command is not found, one of two things happen:
.PP
1. Command names containing a slash are simply executed without performing any searches.
.PP
2. The shell searches each entry in the PATH variable in turn for the command. The value of the PATH variable should be a series of entries separated by colons. Each entry consists of a directory name. The current directory may be indicated implicitly by an empty directory name, or explicitly by a single period.

.SH EXAMPLE
.br
.PP 
.B cd command: 
.PP 
The 'cd' commnad let us change the current directory.
.PP
```
.PP
Plankton cd [directory_name]
.PP
Plankton cd dir_1/dir_2/dir_3
.PP
```
.PP
.B pwd command:
.PP
The 'pwd' command let us know the completly current library direction.
.PP
To print it use syntax:
.PP
```
.PP
Plankton pwd
.PP
```
.PP
.B echo command:
.PP
The 'echo' command prints a string directly in the console.
.PP
To print a string use syntax:
.PP
```
.PP
Plankton echo "Hey, I am a Plankton shell"
.PP
```
.PP
.B rm command:
.PP
The 'rm' command removes files from the system without confirmation.
.PP
To remove a file use syntax:
.PP
```
.PP
Plankton rm [filename]
.PP
```
